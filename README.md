# Maxima: Resort Reservation Management System

**Maxima** is a **Resort Reservation Management System** that I developed when I was first learning web development. The code is **unorganized and not maintainable** because I was still in the early stages of learning. However, it works as intended.

## Features
- Basic resort booking and reservation system  
- User management  
- Functional but lacks structure and best practices  

## Why the Code is Not Maintainable  
When I started this project, I was just learning web development. At that time, I focused on making things work rather than writing clean or maintainable code. Over time, I learned better coding practices, but this project remains in its original state as a reflection of my learning journey.  

## Future Improvements  
- Refactor the code for better maintainability  
- Improve UI/UX  
- Optimize performance and security  

Feel free to explore or improve the project if needed!
